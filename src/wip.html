					Introduction
				</h2>
				If youâ€™re reading this, chances are you were invited to join a group to play D&D or another role playing game, and itâ€™s your first time doing so. Or you found a group to play with, but want to know to expect when you show up for your first game. Or youâ€™ve been playing forever and youâ€™re looking to see if this is a good guide to send to prep a new player.[1] (see appendix for hardcore nerds)
				<hr class="m-6 border-orange-200">
				Whether your aware of it or not, weâ€™re in the midst of a D&D renaissance, led by the popularity of streaming groups like Critical Role, and kindled by the release of the latest editions of the both the official Dungeons & Dragons game and its popular sibling, Pathfinder.

					Who is this for
				</h2>
				This guide is for complete beginners. Most people have had some exposure to D&D: they know someone who plays, theyâ€™ve read an article about the game, or theyâ€™ve seen part of an episode of critical role. But this guide doesnâ€™t assume any of that; to be as accessible as possible, it assumes that youâ€™ve just found or have been invited to a game, and youâ€™re aware that Dungeons & Dragons exists - and thatâ€™s all you need to know to continue.
				<hr class="m-6 border-orange-200">
				If youâ€™re a little farther in your D&D journey, this guide still might be handy for you. Maybe youâ€™re already a critter (a big fan of Critical Role) but havenâ€™t yet played in a game yourself. Or you played back in high school but donâ€™t remember much about the game. Either way, I think thereâ€™s something of value here for everyone. Even if youâ€™re an intermediate to advanced player and/or a seasoned GM, this guide may be able to serve as a lens through which you can see the game as a beginner again, to help remember how important a little guidance, empathy, and fun can be for a new player.
